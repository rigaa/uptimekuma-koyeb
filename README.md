# Uptime Kuma on Koyeb with Healthchecks.io Keep-Alive

Deploy Uptime Kuma on Koyeb with automatic keep-alive using Healthchecks.io to prevent instance sleeping.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Create Healthchecks.io Account
- Go to [healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io/) and sign up
- Create a new check with:
  - **Name**: `Uptime Kuma Keep-Alive`
  - **Schedule**: `*/4 * * * *` (every 4 minutes)
  - **Timezone**: Your timezone
  - **Grace Time**: `1 minute`

### 2. Get Your Ping URL
- Copy the **Ping URL** from your check (format: `https://hc-ping.com/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

### 3. Set Koyeb Environment Variables
In your Koyeb app dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables** and add:

| Variable | Value | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `HEALTHCHECKS_PING_URL` | Your Ping URL from healthchecks.io | `https://hc-ping.com/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc` |
| `KOYEB_APP_NAME` | Your Koyeb app name | `my-uptime-kuma` |

### 4. Deploy
- This repository will auto-deploy on Koyeb
- The keep-alive script will run automatically

## üîß How It Works

- A background script pings both healthchecks.io and your app every 4 minutes
- Prevents Koyeb from putting your instance to sleep (sleeps after 5 minutes inactivity)
- Healthchecks.io monitors if the keep-alive is working
- You get alerts if the keep-alive stops working

## üìä Verification

### Check if Keep-Alive is Working

1. **Healthchecks.io Dashboard**: Should show green checkmarks
2. **Koyeb Logs**: Look for "Healthchecks ping sent" messages
3. **Manual Test**: 
   ```bash
   curl -I https://your-app-name.koyeb.app
